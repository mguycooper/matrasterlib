### A library of matlab functions for processing raster-format (spatially referenced gridded) satellite and climate model data in MatlabÂ©

I have been working on a Matlab package to work with gridded data (satellite and climate model data) in Matlab. The main thing I am trying to accomplish is to reduce the number of functions and steps required to spatially reference gridded data. For example, netcdf files typically include x/y or lat/lon vectors, and sometimes a 2-d grid, but most functions in the Mapping Toolbox require the R or refmat spatial reference objects. Secondly, Matlab separates the functions into two additional categories: 1) geographic vs planar, and 2) 'cells' vs 'postings'. The latter refers to whether the x/y or lat/lon coordinates define the centroid of the grid cells vs the cell edges, where centroids are typical for climate model data but cell edges are typical for satellite imagery. The third major problem I wanted to solve was what would be called co-registration in Arc, but also re-sampling and clipping. Combining the three operations together might be called 'align raster'. If I have two gridded datasets with different spatial resolutions and extent, I want to be able to quickly align them so they have identical spatial resolution and extent. 

I wrote two functions to solve these problems: 1) [rasterref.m](rasterref.m), and 2) [rasterinterp.m](rasterinterp.m). Rasterref accepts 2-d grids of lat/lon or x/y coordinates and returns the R spatial referencing object. Rasterinterp accepts two different R objects where the first one defines the raster you want to align and the second defines the raster to which you want to align the first one, and the raster itself, and returns the resampled/aligned raster. I also wrote a function [rastersurf.m](rastersurf.m) to quickly plot the raster.
